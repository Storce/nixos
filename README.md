This is a fork of NixOS configs from my friend @gustavogarone. Check him out!
# Notes
1. I use some absolute pathing in some of the configurations (skill issue Im
   dumb). I assume that this repository sits at $HOME/nixos
2. When loading config onto new machines, do not forget to update the hardware
   IDs. Everything else should be fine.
3. My configs do include some unfree software (ex. spotify) so be warned, ig.
