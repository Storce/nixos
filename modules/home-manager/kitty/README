More skill issue moment! The kitty.conf being built has the default theme
appended after my desired theme. I don't know why, and I don't want to spend
time figure out why. So...

I am just appending ANOTHER include statement pointing to this directory with
the Kanagawa config. Yes this is cursed, yes yet another hard-coded path. But
what can I do. Im dumb.
