This is a fork of NixOS configs from my friend @gustavogarone. Check him out!
# Setup
1. I use some absolute pathing in some of the configurations (skill issue but Im
   dumb). I assume that this repository sits at $HOME/nixos
2. When loading config onto new machines, do not forget to update the hardware
   IDs. Everything else should be fine.
